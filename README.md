# Image Colour Palette Generator

In this project, the user uploads an image, chooses a number N of colours, and, using the Machine Learning KMeans algorithm, the application retrieves the N most prevalent colours in the image (in no particular order). Due to the nature of the KMeans algorithm results may vary in each request. This is because the KMeans algorithm chooses different centroids at random in each different try.
